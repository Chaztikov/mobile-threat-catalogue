In order to fully address the inherent threats of mobile devices, a wider view of the mobile ecosystem is necessary. This repository contains the Mobile Threat Catalogue,
which describes, identifies, and structures the threats posed to mobile information systems. Readers of the catalogue will notice there are gaps;
some threats are not tied to a documented source or lack countermeasures, and other threats not identified here may exist. The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) seeks comment on current
mobile threats addressed in the Catalogue as well as ideas for additional threats to add. Go to the [contributing.md](contributing.md) file for more information on how to provide feedback

An associated report provide context and describing this repository is available here:
[NISTIR 8144: Assessing Threats to Mobile Devices & Infrastructure](https://nccoe.nist.gov/sites/default/files/library/mtc-nistir-8144-draft.pdf).

The comment period closes on Monday, November 10, 2016.
