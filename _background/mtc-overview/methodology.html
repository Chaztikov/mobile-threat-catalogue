<h1 class="page-heading">Methodology</h1>

<p>NCCoE’s mobile security engineers performed a foundational review of mobile security literature in order to identify major categories of mobile threats. Building upon this knowledge, threats were identified using a modified NIST SP 800-30 risk assessment process. One of the primary drivers for change was the lack of a specific information system under review. A single mobile deployment was not under review – instead the threats posed to foundational mobile technologies were analyzed. Therefore, key risk information necessitated by NIST SP 800-30 such as likelihood, impact, and overall risk was unavailable and not included. Threats were identified in communication mechanisms, the mobile supply chain, and at each level of the mobile device technology stack. These threats were then placed into threat categories alongside information pertaining to specific instantiations of these threats.</p>
<p>During the threat identification process, it was necessary to identify which associated systems would be included and applicable mitigation capabilities. The mitigation capabilities are inclusive of a mobile security literature review and submissions resulting from the request for information on mobile threats and defenses, which support the congressional study on mobile device security. A broad scope was used in an effort to be comprehensive. The threats listed in the catalogue are sector-agnostic. For instance, threats pertaining to the use of mobile devices in a medical setting are not included. The exception to this is the inclusion of threats pertaining to the telecommunications industry, since this includes threats to cellular networks and infrastructure by definition.</p>
