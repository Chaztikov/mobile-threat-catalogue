NIST 800-30 Revision 1 defines a threat as “any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, or modification of information, and/or denial of service”. For each threat identified within our analysis, the following information is provided:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Threat Category</b>: The major topic area pertaining to this threat. Topic areas are further divided when necessary, and are discussed in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/background/mtc-overview/category-descriptions.html">category descriptions</a>.</li>
	<li><b>Threat Identifier (ID)</b>: The Threat ID is a unique identifier for referencing a specific threat. The broad identifier categories used within the MTC are:
		<ul>
			<li><i>APP</i>: Application</li>
			<li><i>STA</i>: Stack</li>
			<li><i>CEL</i>: Cellular</li>
			<li><i>GPS</i>: Global Positioning System</li>

		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Threat Origin</b>: Reference to the source material used to initially identify the threat.</li>
	<li><b>Exploit Example</b>: A reference to the vulnerability’s origin or examples of specific instances of this threat.</li>
	<li><b>Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) Reference</b>: A specific vulnerability located within the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) [10]. A vulnerability origin may describe a specific vulnerability, which may, or may not, be associated with a CVE.</li>
	<li><b>Possible Countermeasure</b>: Security controls or mitigations that could reduce the impact of a particular threat. If a countermeasure is not present, it may be an area for future research.</li>
</ul>  
<p>The CVE is a dictionary of publicly known information security vulnerabilities and exposures.</p>
